                <h1>Why Pragati?</h1>
                <p>While there are several means and opportunities for the urban women to earn, the rural kind is often
                    left to struggle.
                    Pragati is a one-of-a-kind platform to enable women to apply their self-learnt skills to use and
                    become the backbone of
                    the family. We empower rural women by creating earning opportunities which contribute to economic
                    growth. Additionally,
                    we aim to help in bringing back India’s deteriorating traditional artifact culture. Women will be
                    able to independently
                    build their business without the need of family support or investment, thus paving the path for a
                    confident and
                    respectable future ahead.</p>

                            becoming the creators of
                            change. Women who want to work in their field of interest and boost their career shall be
                            helped
                            by our website. A plus
                            point is that there would be no involvement of middlemen for buying and selling, hence
                            customers
                            would be able to buy
                            the products at reasonable prices. Some of the most flourished handicrafts and artifacts are
                            made by women. With our
                            portal, we could help preserve the traditional culture and uplift women who deserve much
                            more
                            success and recognition.

                        <p id="paragraph1">Rural India has commonly observed that men are the sole earning members in
                            85%
                            - 90% of the families. Numerous
                            circumstances disallow a woman to go out and make a living, even if she wishes to. Most
                            common reason being, no support
                            or “permission” granted by family. Considering these issues, we thought of innovating a
                            solution, empowering talented
                            housewives to earn independently from home without relocating, and simultaneously attempt to
                            preserve the dying heritage
                            of Indian “hand-made” goods. Since the process would be completely virtual, women can gain
                            recognition and become
                            self-sufficient from the comfort of their home without sacrificing responsibilities towards
